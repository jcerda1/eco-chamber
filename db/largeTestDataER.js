    body: 'The engines used on the Southwest Airlines flight that made an emergency landing in Philadelphia due to an apparent catastrophic engine failure were built by CFM, a joint venture between U.S.-based General Electric and French company Safran Aircraft Engines.\n\nCFM\'s CFM56-7B engines were used to power the 18-year-old Boeing 737-700 aircraft, which was operating as Southwest Flight 1380. Bound for Dallas, Texas, the flight departed LaGuardia around 10:30 a.m. ET and landed in the Pennsylvania city around an hour later after one of the aircraft\'s engines exploded mid-flight. Officials confirmed one person had died and several others were injured after the emergency landing.\n\nThe CFM56-7B model is the exclusive engine of Boeing\'s "737 Next Generation" of aircraft - a partnership which began in July 1993 and includes the 700 series - and produces 19,500 to 27,300 pounds of thrust, the company said. The engines have been in use since 1997 and power more than 6,700 aircraft globally.\n\nIn response to Tuesday\'s incident, the U.S.-French company said it sent a team of technical representatives to Philadelphia to assist the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in its investigation into what caused the explosion.\n\n"CFM will support the NTSB and Southwest Airlines in determining the cause of the accident," the company said in a statement. "CFM and GE will make every resource necessary available to ensure support."\n\nThe company was formed in September 1974 as a 50/50 joint venture between GE and Snecma - the latter which became Safran Aircraft Engines in May 2016.\n\nWhile numerous types of commercial aircraft use CFM engines, the company\'s largest customer is the U.S. Air Force, which received its first re-engined KC-135R tanker from CFM in April 1984.',

    body: 'A Southwest Airlines jet apparently blew an engine at about 30,000 feet and got hit by shrapnel that smashed a window and damaged the fuselage Tuesday, killing a passenger and injuring seven others, authorities said.\n\nThe plane, a twin-engine Boeing 737 bound from New York to Dallas with 149 people aboard, made an emergency landing in Philadelphia just before noon as passengers breathing through oxygen masks that dropped from the ceiling said their prayers and braced for impact.\n\n"I just remember holding my husband\'s hand, and we just prayed and prayed and prayed," said passenger Amanda Bourman, of New York. "And the thoughts that were going through my head of course were about my daughters, just wanting to see them again and give them a big hug so they wouldn\'t grow up without parents."\n\nNational Transportation Safety Board chairman Robert Sumwalt said one person was killed. It was the first passenger fatality in an accident involving a U.S. airline since 2009, Sumwalt said.\n\nSeven other people were treated for minor injuries, Philadelphia Fire Commissioner Adam Thiel said. He said there was a fuel leak in one of the engines when firefighters arrived and a small fire was quickly brought under control.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration said the crew reported damage to one of the engines, the fuselage and at least one window. The NTSB sent a team of investigators to Philadelphia. Sumwalt said the engine will be taken apart and examined to understand what caused the failure.\n\nBourman said she was seated near the back and was asleep when she heard a loud noise and oxygen masks dropped. She said the plane was fairly quiet because everyone was wearing a mask.\n\n"Everybody was crying and upset," she said. "You had a few passengers that were very strong, and they kept yelling to people, you know, \'It\'s OK! We\'re going to do this!\'"\n\nPassenger Marty Martinez went on Facebook Live while wearing an oxygen mask. He posted, "Something is wrong with our plane! It appears we are going down! Emergency landing!! Southwest flight from NYC to Dallas!!" After the plane landed, he posted photos of a broken window near the left engine.\n\nEveryone started yelling to brace for impact as the plane came in for a landing, Bourman said. She said passengers clapped and praised the pilot after he set the aircraft down.\n\nBourman said she saw emergency workers using a defibrillator to help a woman who was then taken off the plane. Bourman said that she also saw a man in a cowboy hat rush to cover the broken window and that the man had a bandage around his arm after the plane landed.\n\nPassengers did "some pretty amazing things under some pretty difficult circumstances," Thiel said.\n\nTracking data from FlightAware.com showed Flight 1380 was heading west over Pennsylvania at about 32,200 feet (10 km) and traveling 500 mph (800 kph) when it abruptly turned toward Philadelphia.\n\nThe last time a passenger died in an accident on a U.S. airliner was 2009, when 49 people on board and one on the ground were killed in the crash of a Continental Express plane near Buffalo, New York.\n\nSouthwest has about 700 planes, all of them 737s, including more than 500 737-700s like the one in Tuesday\'s accident. It is the world\'s largest operator of the 737. The 737 is the best-selling jetliner in the world and has a good safety record.\n\nJohn Goglia, a former NTSB member, said investigators will take the engine apart and look at its maintenance records as well.\n\n"There\'s a ring around the engine that\'s meant to contain the engine pieces when this happens," Goglia said. "In this case it didn\'t. That\'s going to be a big focal point for the NTSB -- why didn\'t (the ring) do its job?"\n\nGoglia said the Boeing 737 is a safe plane but engine failures happen from time to time.\n\n"We\'re pushing the engines to produce as much power as possible," he said. "We\'re right on the edge. Sometimes they fail, and that\'s why the containment ring is there."\n\nThe engine failure was reminiscent of a similar event on a Southwest Boeing 737-700 jet in August 2016 as it flew from New Orleans to Orlando, Florida. Shrapnel from the engine left a 5-by-16-inch hole just above the wing, and the oxygen masks dropped. The plane landed safely in Pensacola, Florida.\n\nNTSB investigators said one of the engine\'s fan blades broke off during the flight, apparently because of metal fatigue.\n\nBefore Tuesday, Southwest had never had an accident-related fatality of a passenger, although a boy died in 2006 when a Southwest jet skidded off a runway at Chicago\'s Midway Airport, crashed through a fence and collided with the boy\'s family\'s car.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that the plane was over Pennsylvania, not New York, when it abruptly changed course.\n\n___\n\nKoenig reported from Dallas. Associated Press writers Kristen de Groot and Claudia Lauer in Philadelphia, and Matthew Barakat in Washington, contributed to this story.',

    body: 'Federal airline regulators are planning to order inspections on jet engine blades after one such blade broke off of a plane mid-flight on Tuesday, resulting in a fatal accident that required an emergency landing.\n\nThe nation\'s top flight authority, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), said Wednesday it will announce a new plan in the coming two weeks for inspections on certain models of CFM56 engines, according to The Associated Press.\n\nInvestigators say that a Southwest Airlines jetliner bound for Dallas, Texas on Tuesday was forced to make an emergency landing in Philadelphia because of one such fan blade.\n\nThe fan blade broke off from Southwest Flight 1380, damaging the engine mid-flight and seriously damaging the left wing. One woman was partially sucked out of a damaged window and later died from injuries sustained in the incident. Others sustained minor injuries.\n\nThe FAA\'s new directive will mandate inspections on fan blades for wear and tear after a certain number of landings and takeoffs, which will likely result in the more frequent replacement of the blades, The AP reports.\n\nLawmakers this week have called for the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to hold hearings on aviation safety in response to the crash. Lawmakers want to reassure passengers of airline safety after the first deadly U.S. flight incident in nearly a decade.\n\nA similar accident involving a fan blade failure in a Southwest airliner in 2016 prompted the engine\'s manufacturer to call for more routine inspections of blades on 737 aircraft.',

Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines said it will speed up inspections for the CFM56 engines.\n\n"The accelerated inspections are being performed out of an abundance of caution and are expected to be completed over the next 30 days," the airline said in a statement. "The accelerated checks are ultrasonic inspections of fan blades of the CFM56 engines".\n\nSumwalt said he spoke with Southwest CEO Gary Kelly, who assured the chairman that the airline will conduct inspections on its fleet.\n\n"He has told me that southwest will immediately begin enhanced inspections procedures involving ultrasonic inspection," Sumwalt said.

Debris from the engine hit the plane and damaged a window, leading to a woman being partially blown out.

    body: '"I grabbed my wife\'s hand and I started praying: \'Dear Jesus, send some angels. Just save us from this,\'" said Timothy C. Bourman, 36, a pastor from Woodside, N.Y., who was on his way to a church retreat in San Antonio. "I thought we were goners."\n\nIn the cockpit, the pilot, Tammie Jo Shults, a veteran Navy pilot, flew on with one engine and calmly radioed air traffic controllers in Philadelphia to discuss her approach. She told them the flight was carrying injured passengers and needed emergency medics on the ground.\n\n"Is your airplane physically on fire?" an air traffic controller asked Ms. Shults, according to audio captured by LiveATC.\n\n"No it\'s not on fire, but part of it is missing," she responded. "They said there\'s a hole and someone went out."\n\nOn Wednesday, Robert L. Sumwalt, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said there was evidence of metal fatigue on the left engine of the plane, a two-engine Boeing 737. Mr. Sumwalt also said that investigators had discovered that a fan blade was missing from the plane\'s other engine.\n\nRobert W. Mann, an airline analyst, said this kind of metal fatigue is virtually impossible to see until a failure has already occurred. It is always destructive when a blade comes loose, although it is unusual for uncontained engine failures to be deadly, he said.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, as the flight descended toward Philadelphia, some passengers scrambled to put on oxygen masks while others hurried to buy internet access so they could send a last message to their children and families. Marty Martinez, 29, of Dallas, held a yellow oxygen mask to his face as he live-streamed the descent on Facebook. "It appears we are going down!" he wrote.\n\nPastor Bourman said he could not figure out how to use his mask, and decided it would not save him if the plane crashed. Instead, he sat and prayed as his wife, Amanda, managed to connect her phone to the plane\'s Wi-Fi. They began texting Pastor Bourman\'s father to tell him what had happened and to convey a message to the couple\'s three daughters, 6, 4 and 2 years old:\n\nTell the girls we love them and that Jesus is with them always.\n\nOn the right side of the plane, just across from the blown-out window, Sheri Sears said her friend and travel companion, Tim McGinty, reassured his wife and Ms. Sears that they would be fine, and tightened their seatbelts. Then he sprang up to help drag the injured passenger, Jennifer Riordan, back into the plane.\n\nMs. Riordan was unconscious and bleeding as Mr. McGinty and another passenger, a firefighter from north of Dallas, laid her across a row of seats. A retired nurse rushed up and helped Mr. McGinty perform CPR all the way to Philadelphia, but it was no use. Ms. Riordan, a Wells Fargo executive and mother of two from Albuquerque, was pronounced dead at a hospital.\n\nAs the passengers tried to save Ms. Riordan, Ms. Sears thought about her 11-year-old daughter, Tyley. Ms. Sears\'s own father had died when she was 7, and she kept thinking to herself: I\'m not going to be there for her.\n\nShe said she offered a thin prayer for mercy: "If this is your will, God, please let me go quickly. Don\'t let me suffer."',

    title: 'Engine on Southwest Jet Not the Only One to Develop Cracks',
    body: 'He said that in the past, engines were designed with an abundance of precaution. "They don\'t do that anymore. They\'re trying to whittle down every last bit of material, every bit of weight. Thrust is king."\n\nBut, Mr. Giannotti said, "there is such a thing as pushing things. We try to get right to the edge, with as little edge as possible, without stepping over."\n\nIn the case of the Southwest engine failure this week, investigators say they are not only considering why a fan blade broke but why the engine housing failed to contain it. The shrapnel punctured a window in the plane, and a woman seated by it was partially sucked out. She was later pronounced dead.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration had already been close to ordering airlines using that particular engine, the CFM-56B, to conduct ultrasonic inspections. The agency appears to have been prompted to act after another Southwest 737 engine came apart in 2016, sending debris into the plane\'s fuselage, wing and tail. The investigation into that incident is ongoing.\n\nLate Wednesday, the F.A.A. said it was ordering those ultrasonic inspections. The engines on both Southwest planes, were manufactured by CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric and Safran of France.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board concluded that visual inspections between flights were insufficient to detect flaws in the disk of a CF-6 engine on an American Airlines Boeing 767 in late 2016. The plane was gaining speed on the runway in Chicago when the engine broke apart, sending metal fragments into the fuel tank and igniting a fire. The engine was manufactured by General Electric.\n\nThe chairman of the transportation safety board, Robert L. Sumwalt, said on Wednesday that the problems with the Southwest engine were worrisome because the agency had already discovered in the Chicago incident that some engine flaws were undetectable. "We are concerned about it," Mr. Sumwalt said.\n\nInspections have also been ordered for the Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines that power a quarter of Boeing\'s newest wide-body, the 787 Dreamliner, after cracks were found on rotor blades. But the F.A.A. went further and rescinded the operators\' approval to fly the airplanes any farther than 2 hours and 20 minutes from an emergency airport.\n\nInternational long-haul carriers like United Airlines, Qantas Airways, Japan Airlines, Air New Zealand and British Airways purchased the Dreamliner over the past decade specifically for the plane\'s ability to carry people on longer routes. On extended flights over water, an airline could schedule flights on routes of up to five hours flying time from an emergency airport.\n\nAmerican and European regulators now say that cannot be safely accomplished. Should one Rolls-Royce engine fail, the higher power demand on the remaining engine could cause the second engine to fail.\n\n"It\'s pretty frightening," said Mr. Giannotti, the aerospace engineer. "What is very clear is, there is a design flaw in the engine."\n\nLATAM Airlines, British Airways and Norwegian Air are three airlines that must now lease substitute airplanes or reassign other model aircraft to certain destinations, an expensive disruption.\n\n"We are carrying out detailed precautionary inspections on Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines on our Boeing 787s to ensure we meet all the relevant regulatory requirements," said Michele Kropf, a spokeswoman for British Airways. She declined to provide details of how the carrier was handling transoceanic routes on which it flies its 787s.\n\nAlthough engine failure is not common, the bigger risk is when pieces of the motor fly out. "There\'s a lot of mass behind them," said Robert Benzon, a former investigator with the transportation safety board. "Because of the centrifugal forces involved, if they shoot out in the wrong direction, they can do anything."\n\nFor more than a half-century, jet engines have taken the lead in advancing the capabilities of airliners, with each engine more powerful than the newest plane. The Dreamliner engines, for example, generate enough energy to power 30 homes. They do more than just propel the plane through the sky; they provide power to the airplane\'s demanding and complex systems.\n\nThe recent engine failures have certainly been disruptive and attention-getting, but do not necessarily indicate a trend, though Mr. Benzon said it might.\n\n"It\'s up to the industry and the entities, the investigators, the certification people, the F.A.A. in our case, to see if there is a trend and rectify it," he said.',

"If I was going to look at all the probabilities for a fatal accident, it would not have been this."\n\nThe initial cause of the engine failure this week, which forced the flight to make an emergency landing in Philadelphia, is believed to have been metal fatigue -- the same problem that investigators think caused an engine failure on another Southwest 737 in August 2016.\n\nThat episode caused no deaths, but it prompted federal transportation regulators, the engine manufacturer and airlines to agree that more thorough engine inspections were necessary. Nearly two years later, those inspections are not yet mandatory in the United States.',

Two years ago, the manufacturer of the engine said the flaws suspected in the Southwest accident could be detected only with more thorough, ultrasound inspections.\n\nThe plane, a Boeing 737-700, and its engine are mainstays in the sky. Southwest\'s fleet, more than 700 planes, is made up entirely of 737 models. They have a stellar safety record, as do the engines, which are made by CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric and France\'s Safran.
